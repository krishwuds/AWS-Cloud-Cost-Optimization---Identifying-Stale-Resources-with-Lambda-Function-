## Introduction

Welcome to the AWS Cloud Cost Optimization project, which utilizes AWS Lambda and Python to automate the identification and management of stale resources in your AWS environment. Stale resources can significantly contribute to unnecessary costs in your AWS account, and this solution aims to simplify their detection and cleanup.

**Why Cost Optimization Matters?**

AWS offers an extensive range of services and resources, making it easy for unused or underutilized resources to accumulate and inflate your AWS bills. This project addresses this challenge by:

- Automatically identifying stale resources.
- Providing cost analysis to understand potential savings.
- Automating the cleanup process using AWS Lambda functions.
- Enabling continuous monitoring to prevent future resource accumulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to access and manage AWS Lambda functions, IAM roles, and CloudWatch Logs.

## Usage

Your AWS Cloud Cost Optimization solution is already deployed in your AWS account. Here's how to get started:

1. **Access the UI**: Navigate to the web-based user interface (UI) of your AWS Cloud Cost Optimization solution. You can typically find the UI URL or endpoint in your AWS resources.

2. **Login**: If required, log in to the UI using your AWS credentials or the provided authentication method.

3. **Initiate Resource Identification**: Use the UI to initiate the identification of stale resources in your AWS environment. This action may trigger the associated AWS Lambda function.

4. **Review Cost Analysis**: Once the identification process is complete, review the cost analysis reports generated by the solution. These reports will help you understand potential cost savings.

5. **Initiate Resource Cleanup**: Based on the cost analysis and your preferences, you can initiate resource cleanup operations directly from the UI. The AWS Lambda function will execute the cleanup tasks.

6. **Monitor and Optimize**: Continuously monitor the status of your AWS resources and cost optimization efforts using the UI. Set up alerts or notifications for resource changes as needed.

## Features

- User-friendly web-based interface for resource management.
- Automated identification of stale AWS resources.
- Cost analysis to estimate potential cost savings.
- One-click resource cleanup initiation.
- Continuous monitoring and cost optimization.
